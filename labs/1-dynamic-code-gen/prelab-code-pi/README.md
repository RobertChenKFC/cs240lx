Some simple examples of generating code dynamically:
  - `0-ident-dcg.c`: trivial example of generating code.
  - `1-self-modifying.c`: trivial example of self modifying code
  - `2-bug-self-modify.c`: isolating weird behavior that shows up
    with self-modifying code.
  - `4-derive-pc-reg.c`: example of checking instruction semantics
    by writing and executing code.
