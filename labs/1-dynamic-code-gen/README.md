## Lab: machine code tricks: jits, self-modifying, reverse engineering.

Today we'll hack machine code.  It's a great way to get a concrete,
no-bullshit view of how hardware actually works.  It also let's you do
cool tricks not possible within high level code.

Machine code is the integers used to encode machine instructions.  It's
even lower-level than even assembly, which at least is character strings.
For example, the assembly for our `GET32` which loads from an address
and returns the value looks like:

        GET32:
            ldr r0,[r0]     @ load address held in r0 into r0
            bx lr           @ return

Whereas the machine code is two 32-bit integers:

            0xe5900000  #  ldr r0,[r0] 
            0xe12fff1e  #  bx lr 

It's easy to set the wrong bit in machine code, which can completely
transform the meaning of the instruction or, only slightly change it,
so it uses the wrong register or wrong memory address, birthing wildly
difficult bugs.

With that said, generating machine code is fun, kind of sleazy, and
most people have no idea how to do it.  So it makes sense as a lab for
our class.

As discussed in the `PRELAB` its used for many things, from the original
VMware, machine simulators (closely related!), JIT compilers you may
well use everyday, and even nested functions in gcc.

A second nice thing about generating machine code is that it really
gives you a feel for how the machine actually operates.  When you do
today's lab you will realize that --- surprisingly --- assembly code is
actually high-level in many ways(!) since the assembler and linker do many
tricky things for you.  (E.g., linking jumps to their destinations.)
You will implement a bunch of these things (next lab).

The theory behind today's lab is that we'll do concrete examples of a
bunch of different things so that it removes a bunch of the mystery.
Subsequent lab will go more in depth, where you can build out the things
you do today.

We'll do a bunch of simple examples that show how to exploit both
runtime machine code generation or self-modifying to get speed or 
expressivity.


### 140e students

Some of you have done some of the below as extensions.  There's
a bunch of other stuff to do instead:
  1. Redo the lab to generate the code on your laptop.  This will likely
     require defeating exploit-proofing the OS has put in place
     (e.g., disallowing executing heap memory).

     Even better: make a fake little RISC language (you can look at the
     vcode paper) and have two backends: one that JITs to your laptop,
     one that JITs to the pi.

  2. Change the "full-except" code in 140E to use jitting to jump 
     right to the user handler.  Tune your interrupt handler to 
     be as fast as possible and make sure you get the same results.

  3. Implement a veneer for the performance monitoring unit on the
     arm1176 (this is 3-133 to 3-138) and use this to determine 
     why exactly you are getting speedups.

  4. Add support to flush the data cache and instruction cache 
     on the exact regions that were modified.

There's various other hacks you can do; let us know if you need them!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Part 0: Getting started.

The first barrier to genenerating machine code is to wrap your head
around specifying it.  As a quick hack, write code that genenerates a
routine that returns a small constant.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Part 1: write a `hello world`

Generate a routine to call `printk("hello world\n")` and return.
  - `code/1-hello` has the starter code.

Note: to help figure things out, you should:
  1. Write a C routine to call `printk` statically and return.
  2. Look at the disassembly.
  3. Implement the code to generate those functions.  I would suggest
     by using the cheating approach in `code/examples`.  
  4. To make it really simple, you might want to write exactly those
     values you get from disassembly to make sure everything is working
     as you expect.

I'd suggest writing routines to generate relative branching (both with
and without linking):

    // <src_addr> is where the call is and <target_addr> is where you want
    // to go.
    uint32_t arm_b(uint32_t src_addr, uint32_t target_addr);
    uint32_t arm_bl(uint32_t src_addr, uint32_t target_addr);


----------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Part 2: Runtime inlining.

***[NOTE: do this after part 3 and 4 which are a lot easier to debug.]***

Modern C compilers generally only inline routines that are in the same
file (or included header file).  And even then they may only do it if it
the definition appears before the use.

Because of heavy use of seperate compilation, many routines that could be usefully
inlined cannot, because their implementations are not known until all the 
`.o` files are linked together.  When I was a kid, there were
various link-time optimizers (OM from David Wall was great) but now, they are
rare.

If you know machine code, you can write your own inliner.  We'll do so
by changing GET32 and PUT32 to reach back into their caller and rewrite
the callsite.  The `1-getput` has a its own GET32 and PUT32 implementations.
These have two parts:
  1. Assembly level that calls the C code with the address of the caller.
  2. C-code that uses this address to reach back into the caller (this isn't
     needed: you can everything in assembly.)

What you need for PUT32:
  1. Machine code to do a store.  From the original machine code:

            00008024 <PUT32>:
                8024:   e5801000    str r1, [r0]
                8028:   e12fff1e    bx  lr

     Thus, the store is `0xe5801000`.  

  2. So, given the address of the call instruction (`lr` holds 4 bytes past this) 
     we can overwrite the original call instruction with the store.

Why this works:
  1. The store instruction takes as much space as the call instruction
     so we can replace it without expanding or contracting the program binary.
  2. We know `r0` and `r1` hold the right values at this program address, because 
     otherwise the call wouldn't work.
  3. We don't have the icache or dcache on, so we don't need to manually 
     synchronize them.

Similar logic holds for `GET32`.

The test code will run with and without the modification and measures the 
performance improvement for a trivial program.

Some tradeoffs:
  1. We get a speedup.
  2. However, we get less of a speedup than if we inlined at C source code level
     since the compiler could potentially specialize the code further.

Extension: specialize GPIO routines
  1. We needed to do this inlining at runtime since we don't have a
     reliable way to tell code from data and so cannot simply walk over
     the `.bin` file replacing all calls.

  2. However, we can specialize a function definition  since we can find the
     funtion entry point from the elf file and we know its semantics. 
  
  3. So go in the binary and smash different gpio routines, eliminating
     if-statement checks and inlining the GET32 and PUT32 calls.

  4. There are extra three co-processor register registers you can store 
     large constants in to eliminate the cache hit from loading them from
     memory (gcc's preferred method).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Part 3: add executable headers in a backwards compatible way.

Even the ability to stick a tiny bit of executable code in a random place
can give you a nice way to solve problems.  For this part, we use it to
solve a nagging problem we had from `cs140e`.

As you might recall, whenever we wanted to add a header to our pi
binaries, we had to hack on the pi-side bootloader code and sometimes
the unix-side code.  Which was annoying.

However, with a simple hack we could have avoided all of this:  if you
have a header for (say) 64 bytes then:

   1. As the first word in the header (which is the first word of the
      pi binary), put the 32-bit value for a ARMv6 branch (`b`)
      instruction that jumps over the header.

   2. Add whatever other stuff you want to the header in the other
      60 bytes: make sure you don't add more than 64-bytes and that you
      pad up to 64 bytes if you do less.

   3. When you run the code, it should work with the old bootloader.

      It's neat that the ability to write a single jump instruction
      gives you the ability to add an arbitrary header to code and have
      it work transparently in a backwards-compatible way.

More detailed:
   1. Write a new linker script that modifies `./memmap`  to have a header
      etc.  You should store the string `hello` with a 0 as the first
      6 bytes of the after the jump instruction.

   2. Modify `3-jump/hello.c` to set a pointer to where this string will
      be in memory.  The code should run and print it.

   3. For some quick examples of things you can do in these scripts
      you may want to look at the `3-jump/memmap.header` or
      `3-jump/memmap.header` linker scripts from old labs.  The linker
      script language is pretty bad, so if you get confused, it's their
      fault, not yours --- keep going, try google, etc.     We don't
      need much for this lab's script, so it shouldn't be too bad.

   4. To debug, definitely look at the `hello.list` to see what is
      going on.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Part 4: make an interrupt dispatch compiler.

We now do a small, but useful OS-specific hack.  In "real" OSes you
often have an array holding interrupt handlers to call when you get an
interrupt.  This lets you dynamically register new handlers, but adds
extra overhead of traversing the array and doing (likely mis-predicted)
indirect function calls.  If you are trying to make very low-latency
interrupts --- as we will need when we start doing trap-based code
monitoring --- then it would be nice to get rid of this overhead.

We will use dynamic code generation to do so.  You should write an
`int_compile` routine that, given a vector of handlers, generates a
single trampoline routine that does hard-coded calls to each of these
in turn.  This will involve:
  1. Saving and restoring the `lr` and doing `bl` as you did in the 
     `hello` example.
  2. As a hack, you pop the `lr` before the last call and do a
     `b` to the last routine rather than a `bl`.

#### Advanced: jump threading 

To make it even faster you can do "jump threading" where instead of the
interrupt routines returning back into the trampoline, they directly
jump to the next one.  For today, we will do this in a very sleazy way,
using self-modifying code.

Assume we want to call:

    int0();
    int1();
    int2();

We:
   1. Iterate over the instructions in `int0` until we find a `bx lr`.
   2. Compute the `b` instruction we would do to jump from that location
      in the code to `int1`.
   3. Overwrite `int0``s `bx lr` with that value.
   4. Do a similar process for `int1`.
   5. Leave `int2` as-is.   

Now, some issues:
  1. We can no longer call `int0`, `int1` and `int2`  because we've modified
     the executable and they now behave differently.
  2. The code might have have multiple `bx lr` calls or might have data
     in it that looked like it when it should not have.
  3. If we use the instruction cache, we better make sure to flush it or at 
     least the address range of the code.

There are hacks to get around (1) and (2) but for expediency we just
declare success, at least for this lab.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Part 5: make a jitter for dot-product.

Given a sparse vector, generate custom dot product code that hard-codes
the given vectors non-zero values in the instruction stream.

This was the first piece of code I ever wrote that led to publication.
It's fun.  
   1. For each unit test in `armv6-encodings` implement the needed
      instruction.

   2. Write the code in `5-jit-dot` to encode a dot product in the 
      instruction stream, skipping zeros.
