## Lab: using single stepping to check interleaving.

We'll use single-stepping to write a concurrency checker that is tiny
but mighty.

In many tools, we'd want to run a single instruction and then get control
back for a tool.

For this lab you'll have to read the comments. Sorry :( 
  - check-interleave.h: has the the interface.
  - check-interleave.c: has a working version.
  - tests/ has tests. you should build the code so these work.
